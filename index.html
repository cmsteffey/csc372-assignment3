            <h3>About</h3><br>
            <p>This is an overview of good places to grab food on UNCG's campus, especially if you're a computer science student! All of these restaurants are within a close walking distance of the Petty Building, where most computer science students have their classes. They also all have bike parking available, and the bike rides through campus are not very inclined.</p>

                    This entrée is a serving of delightfully sweet chicken on a bed of white rice. This option is a bit dry, so definitely get a free water or other drink with this meal.

                    This cold slushie drink is a great refresher, filled with tangy flavor. This drink includes both orange juice in the ingredients, but also slices of orange which infuse fresh flavor as you drink.

                    This chilly drink is an incredibly sweet mango slushie with pieces of mango in it for flavoring. The straws are big enough and the cubes of mango are small enough that you can eat them through the straw, which makes for a unique but good texture for the drink.

                     This milk-based sweet tea is topped with cream and Oreo crumbles, making a very dessert-y drink. The Oreo bits add a wonderful chocolate taste to the already-delicious tea.

                    This cookie has white chocolate chips mixed in with Oreo cookie pieces, making a delightful mashup. The cookie part itself has a soft texture, and the Oreo pieces add a lovely crunch.

                    Despite looking like a normal sugar cookie, I can say without a doubt this was the best sugar cookie I have ever had. It's buttery smooth, and they are always served warm. They are larger than a standard sugar cookie however, so don't order multiple without knowing their size.

                    This cookie has a chocolate base with both mint chips and M&M pieces added in. The taste is similar to Andes Mints, but the texture is softer and melty. This cookie is very tasty, but the M&M bits get melty, so be careful not to dye your fingers/clothes.
